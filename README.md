Using [deeplearning.js](https://github.com/PAIR-code/deeplearnjs), this is a re-implementation of
[Generating Abstract Patterns with TensorFlow](http://blog.otoro.net/2016/03/25/generating-abstract-patterns-with-tensorflow/) by the amazing [hardmaru](https://github.com/hardmaru)!

I've done it using no other JS libs, and I haven't written JS for many years,
so the code is probably terrible; forgive me!
